      "survey_description": "*Please be advised that this survey is resource-intensive and demands significant RAM for optimal performance. To avoid potential slowdowns, ensure all open windows and background programs are closed. Additionally, a stable internet connection is necessary for smooth operation.*  \n\nThe EENergy Efficiency project has been funded by the EU's Single Market Program (SMP) to support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in improving their energy efficiency performance. \nAll eligible 1,406 EENergy applicants receive support from a sustainability advisor with 707 of them being selected in a lottery to receive grants of up to 10.000 \u20AC to finance the implementation of their energy efficiency action plans. This direct financial support aims to achieve energy efficiency performance improvements through investments in technological solutions, specialized consultancy, and/or upskilling expertise.  \n\nThe program is part of a pilot study, in which the DG GROW aims to better understand the effectiveness of the financial grants provided. For this purpose, an impact evaluation is being conducted alongside the program implementation.  \n\n The evaluation team would like to gain a better understanding of your views on the average impact of receiving the â‚¬10,000 grant in addition to standard support from sustainability advisors, compared to receiving only the standard support. We would greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to share your insights by completing the following questions. With the following questions the evaluation team would like to better understand your beliefs regarding the average impact of receiving the 10.000 \u20AC grant in additon to standard support from sustainability advisors, compared to only receiving the standard support. The team would appreciate if you could take time to fill it out.  \n\nThank you for your time and collaboration!"

It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total energy costs. A higher ratio indicates better energy efficiency, meaning the company generates more revenue per unit of energy cost. For instance, let us say we have two companies, A and B, each with the following figures for a given year:  \n\n- Company A:\n  - Revenue: 1,000,000\u20AC\n  - Energy Costs: 100,000\u20AC\n  - Energy-Revenue Cost Ratio: 1,000,000\u20AC / 100,000\u20AC = 10  \n\n- Company B:\n  - Revenue: 1,500,000\u20AC\n  - Energy Costs: 250,000\u20AC\n  - Energy-Revenue Cost Ratio: 1,500,000\u20AC / 250,000\u20AC = 6  \n\nIn this example, Company A has a higher Energy-Revenue cost ratio (10) compared to Company B (6), indicating that Company A is more efficient in generating revenue per unit of energy cost.
